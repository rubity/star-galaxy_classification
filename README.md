# J-PAS star-galaxy separation via XGBoost

[21 May 2025]

We provide star-galaxy classification, or more precisely a classification of extended (galaxies) vs point-like (stars and quasars) sources, for all J-PAS objects in the **IDR202406** dataset that were observed in at least 40 bands (i.e., fewer than 40 bands with `nan` or `0` in flux), with `i < 22.5` and no mask flags in the i-band (`mask_flags = 0`).  

`label = 0` corresponds to star/quasar, and `label = 1` to galaxy. The output of the model includes both the predicted class (`y_pred`) and the classification probability (`y_prob_star`), where `y_prob_star = 1` indicates maximum confidence that the object is a star/quasar. 

In the resulting **Value-Added Catalog (VAC)**, we include the predicted class and the probability of the source being a star under the column `prob_star` or galaxy/quasar under the column `prob_gal`.

## ML model

We use [[**Auto-sklearn**](https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/master/)], an automated machine learning framework that performs model selection, hyperparameter optimization, and ensembling. The final model is an **ensemble**, meaning it combines multiple machine learning models to produce more robust and accurate predictions. This approach leverages the strengths of different models to reduce variance and improve generalization.
